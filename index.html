		<h3>Experience with Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
    <h4>COM-IoT Technologies</h4>
  </li>
</ul>
		<p>From 05/20/2022 to 08/31/2022 I interned with COM-IoT, a Dubai-based artificial intelligence company.
    During my time there, I learned about how data collected by sensors mounted to a vehicle can be utilized
    by machine learning algorithms to help traffic control protect lives through better traffic violation
    detection. In addition to LiDAR research assignments, I worked on developing the intelligence's knowledge base 
			by annotating over 1,200 pointcloud data frames made by a LiDAR. I identified traffic objects such as cars, trucks, buses, pedestrians, motorcycles, and more. Learning about how software engineers build machine learning algorithms to identify objects
    and the speed of moving vehicles reinforced in my mind the potential for artificial intelligence and
    machine learning to make the world a safer place. </p>
	 
	    <h3>Experience with Hardware Design</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
    <h4>Xprize Rainforest Competition</h4>
  </li>
</ul>
		<p>In the Fall 2022 academic semester, I was part of an interprofessional competition called the Xprize Rainforest. Teams in this competition
			are tasked with developing a solution to collect as much data as possible in 24 hours about the wildlife in the Singapore rainforest.
			Our team's solution included drones that would drop sensor packages around the rainforest.
			The drone had to be equipped with motors to control the latches that would drop the sensor packages, a microprocessor to program the drone components, 
			a motor driver to control the motors, and voltage converters to provide the motors with sufficient voltage. My partner and I
			combined all of these compoents into one printed circuit board. This process included designing the schematic and printed circuit board, 
			programming the arduino microprocessor, and manufacturing the board.

    <h3>Academic Achievements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
    <h4>Highschool - Dubai American Academy</h4>
  </li>
</ul>
    <h4>Certificate of Achievement High Honors with Distinction (GPA of 4.0 or above)</h4>
    <p> I achieved this award every semester of 11th and 12th grade and once in the first semester of 10th grade.
        This certificate is a testament to my strong work ethic that I have developed at a young age. To achieve
        this award I had to be able to excel in my six international baccalaureate courses and regularly perform well on
        assessments.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
    <h4>College - Illinois Institute of Technology</h4>
  </li>
</ul>
    <h4>Dean’s List</h4>
    <p>For all five semesters that I have completed at Illinois Institute of Technology, I have been on the Dean’s
    list. I currently maintain an overall GPA of 3.968 and I expect to improve my GPA in the future.
    Academic discipline and a strong work ethic have always been strengths of mine.</p>

	<h3>Research</h3>
<div class = "research">
	<ul>
		<li><h3>How does the energy that a basketball loses after bouncing on the rim depend on the location at which the basketball is dropped?:</h3> <p>The inspiration for this investigation comes from an event in the 2019 NBA playoffs, during game 7 (the elimination game) in the Eastern Conference semifinals, the Toronto Raptors vs the Philadelphia 76ers. The question the investigation solves is: How does the energy, measured in joules (J), that a basketball loses after bouncing on the rim depend on the displacement from the heel at which it is dropped? You can download the investigation <a href="files/IA Physics - Adam Sadek.docx.pdf" download target=”_blank”>here.</a></p></li>

		<li><h3>Designing a waterproof case for an insulin pump:</h3> <p>In this investigation, I went through the process of designing and producing a waterproof case for the Medtronic: Minimed 530G insulin pump. You can download the investigation <a href="files/DT IA - Adam Sadek.pdf" download target=”_blank”>here.</a></p> </li>

<li><h3>Measuring the effect of voltage exposure on plant growth:</h3> <p>This investigation was based on the effects of electroculture on plant growth. Several plants were exposed to different electromagnetic fields and their growth was measured over two weeks. You can download the investigation <a href="files/Bio IA Plants Exposed to an Electric Current - Ada.docx.pdf" download target=”_blank”>here.</a> </p></li>

<li><h3>Investigating a bouncing basketball and the effect of
air loss on its model:</h3> <p>This investigation involved modeling the bounce of a basketball and how pressure affects the maximum height the ball reaches after each bounce.
